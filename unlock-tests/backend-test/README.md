# Backend Debugging Challenge

## 🎯 Objective
Fix all the bugs in `broken_api.py` to unlock the secret answer code.

## 📋 Instructions

1. Open `broken_api.py` in any code editor
2. Find and fix ALL bugs in the Python code
3. Run the fixed program:
   ```bash
   python broken_api.py
   ```
4. If you fixed everything correctly, you'll see the **SECRET ANSWER CODE**
5. Submit that code to complete the challenge

## 🐛 Types of Bugs to Find

The file contains multiple Python bugs:
- Syntax errors
- Variable name typos
- Missing parameters
- Wrong operators
- Logic errors

## ✅ How to Know You're Done

When you run `python broken_api.py` and see:
```
====================================================
🎉 CONGRATULATIONS! YOU FIXED ALL THE BUGS!
====================================================

Running test cases...

✅ Test 1 Passed: Low complexity - Single lawyer recommended
✅ Test 2 Passed: High complexity - Full legal team required
✅ Test 3 Passed: Medium complexity - Team of 2-3 lawyers recommended

====================================================
🔓 YOUR ANSWER CODE:
====================================================

    WBK2025BE

====================================================

📤 Submit this code to complete the challenge!
```

## 📤 What to Submit

**Submit the Answer Code** that appears when you successfully fix and run the program.

**Format:** A code like `WBK2025XX` (exact format will be revealed)

## ⏱️ Time Limit
30 minutes

## 💡 Hints
- Python syntax requires colons in certain places
- Check variable names carefully (spelling matters!)
- Verify function calls have all required arguments
- Mathematical operators: + vs *
- Python is case-sensitive

## 🧪 Testing
The program includes built-in test cases. When all bugs are fixed:
- All 3 test cases will pass
- The answer code will be displayed
- No errors will occur

## 🎓 Skills Tested
- Python debugging
- Syntax error fixing
- Logic error detection
- API design understanding
- Code reading comprehension

## 📚 Context
This is a legal case complexity analyzer API that:
- Calculates case complexity based on type and documents
- Provides lawyer recommendations
- Generates analysis reports
